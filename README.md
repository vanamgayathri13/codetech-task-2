Student Grade and GPA Calculator
**Overview:**
This Java application allows users to input grades for a specified number of subjects and calculates the average grade, overall letter grade, and Grade Point Average (GPA). It's a simple console-based program that can help students track their academic performance.

F**eatures:**
Input for Multiple Subjects: Users can enter grades for any number of subjects.
Average Calculation: Computes the average grade based on user input.
Letter Grade Determination: Assigns a letter grade (A, B, C, D, F) based on the average.
GPA Calculation: Converts the average grade into a GPA on a 4.0 scale.
**How It Works:**
The program prompts the user to enter the number of subjects.
It then iteratively asks for the grade of each subject.
After all grades are entered, it calculates the average grade, assigns a letter grade, and computes the GPA.
Finally, it displays the results to the user.
**Usage:**
Compile the program using a Java compiler.
Run the program, and follow the prompts to enter the number of subjects and their corresponding grades.
View the output displaying the average grade, overall letter grade, and GPA.
